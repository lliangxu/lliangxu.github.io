# About Me

<!-- <img src="https://llianglxu.github.io/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480"> -->

Here is **Liangliang Xu (Âæê‰∫Æ‰∫Æ)**.

Liangliang Xu is currently an associate professor at [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/). He received his Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Yinlong Xu](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0828/c23235a460084/page.htm) and associate Prof. [Min Lyu](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0906/c23239a460125/page.htm) at University of Science and Technology of China. He has published several papers in top conferences and journals of storage systems, including INFOCOM, ICPP, IPDPS, HotStorage, HotOS, TIT,  TC, TPDS and JPDC. 

His research interests include designing and building dependable techniques (theory + system), e.g., erasure coding (RS/LRC/MSR codes, etc), for distributed persistent/caching(in-memory) storage systems.

Selected Projects
--------------------
1. **MicroEC** [TPDS 2024]
	- This project proposes a new workflow to deploy erasure coding in disaggregated memory storage system. 
	- I design the smart coding stack and fine-granulariity pipeline parallism. This project is implemented atop Apache Crail. 
2. **SelectiveEC** [HotStorage 2020, TPDS 2022]
	- This project proposes a balanced scheduling module, SelectiveEC, to dynamically select some stripes to be reconstructed in a batch, and select source and replacement nodes for each reconstruction task. It achieves balanced network recovery traffic, computing resources and disk I/Os against single node failure in erasure-coded storage systems.
	- I design the scheduling algorithm, build the SelectiveEC prototype and validate it by simulation. 
3. **PDL** [INFOCOM 2020, TC 2021]
	- This project proposes an efficient PBD-based (Pairwise Block Design) Data Layout, PDL, to speed up data repair for single node failure in mixed erasure-coded distributed storage systems. It achieves almost uniform distribution, and higher repair performance due to reduced cross-rack traffic and load balance of read and write I/Os during repair process.
	- I design the data distribution method, and the corresponding failure recovery scheme. And I also implement them in Hadoop 3.1.1. 
4. **D<sup>3</sup>** [IPDPS 2019, TPDS 2020]
	- The proposed distribution D<sup>3</sup> uniformly distributes data/parity blocks among nodes in large scale erasure-coded distributed storage systems, and minimizes the cross-rack repair traffic against a single node failure. 
	- I integrate the distribution D<sup>3</sup> into HDFS-EC module of Hadoop 3.1.0 and evaluate the repair performance over Reed-Solomon codes. In the journal version, I extend it to locally repairable codes, provide efficient strategy to maintain the D<sup>3</sup> data layout after recovery, and conduct more experimental evaluations.
5.  **A Note on One Weight and Two Weight Projective Z<sub>4</sub>-codes** [TIT 2017]
   - This is the work in my undergraduate.
   - I solve the open problems about algebraic codes, moreover, I work out the diophantine problem and then give the sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of two-Lee weight projective codes over Z<sub>4</sub> with type 4<sup>k<sub>1</sub></sup>2<sup>k<sub>2</sub></sup>.
